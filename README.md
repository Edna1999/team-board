# team-board

The following files contain code to create a Team board using node js.
With the use of jest testing I was able to test my class functions.
Once node index.js is run in the terminal a question asking for the type of employee you would like to add will be prompted followed but questions asking for their name, id, email, office number (managers only), github account(engineers only) and the school they attended (interns only).
